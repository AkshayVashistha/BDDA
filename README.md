Project- 1

Housing_California-Dataset
To Build a model of housing prices in California census data
Dataset: Based on data from 1990 California
Background of Problem Statement :
The US Census Bureau has published California Census Data which has 10 types of metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. The dataset also serves as an input for project scoping and tries to specify the functional and nonfunctional requirements for it.
Problem Objective :
The project aims at building a model of housing prices to predict median house values in California using the provided dataset. This model should learn from the data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.
Districts or block groups are the smallest geographical units for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). There are 20,640 districts in the project dataset.


Project- 2 

Green Jobs - Green New York (GJGNY) Residential Loan Portfolio: Beginning November 2010
To Build a model of Loan portfolio 
Dataset: Based on data from 2010 New york 
Background of Problem Statement :
The dataset represents information on the performance of the portfolio of loans issued through the GJGNY Residential Loan Fund. The loan performance results of the GJGNY portfolio have shown strong performance to date, with lower levels of delinquencies and defaults/losses than other consumer loan asset classes. This performance data is useful to lender/capital providers, rating agencies, researchers, and interested stakeholders to assist in anticipating performance results for their-party financing products aimed at consumer clean energy financing. 
Problem Objective :
The project aims at building a model of housing prices to predict performance of the portfolio of loans issued through the GJGNY Residential Loan Fund using the provided dataset. This model should learn from the data and be able to predict the loan performance, given all the other metrics.
